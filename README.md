PRIVACY PROTECTION ISSUES ON CLOUD WITH KEY MANAGEMENT

This project proposed new system that secures information and give protection to the client in cloud. In this Admin will upload the files on cloud storage with generating
security key for secure the files on cloud. Whenever user wants to download the files from cloud storage admin will give the permission and key will sent to user mail with complete
verification. Our technique providing security by using data partition approach and that partitioned data will be proceed further parallel for encryption mechanism. Here privacy
is given by attribute based encryption.

Admin can provide the security to store our data in cloud.users can login into their register mail account after admin can active. Admin and users can upload
their files with a key, based on that key the users can download the files. After enter the key, the key value can be stored in database in encrypted format using attribute
based encryption. Even admin also can not take that files without registering, it is more secure and efficient.
